NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS

== Options

//tag::configuration-properties[]
//end::configuration-properties[]

//end::ref-doc[]

== Build

Build involves two-stages. First build the apps and generate the binder specific app starters projects:
```
$ ./mvnw clean install -PgenerateApps
```

You can find the corresponding binder based projects in the `apps` subfolder. You can then cd into the apps folder:

```
$ cd apps
```
and build all binder projects
```
$ ./mvnw clean package
```

== Examples

```
java -jar face-detection-mtcnn-processor.jar ... use the properties TODO
```

And here is a example pipeline that uses face-detection-mtcnn:

```
face-detection-mtcnn-stream= TODO
```
