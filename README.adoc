# Spring Cloud Stream ComputerVision Applications

Collection of https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters[Spring Cloud Stream App Starters] for Computer Vision (CV) and Image Processing.

Different 3rd party libraries are leveraged, including http://openimaj.org/[OpenIMAJ], https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[javaCV],
http://webcam-capture.sarxos.pl[Sarxos], https://github.com/zxing/zxing[Zxing] and more

Pre-build (snapshot) versions of the apps are available through the http://repo.spring.io/test-libs-snapshot-local[test-libs-snapshot-local] maven repository.
First register the snapshot maven repository to your SCDF server (using `maven.remote-repositories.repo3.url` property):

```
 --maven.remote-repositories.repo3.url=http://repo.spring.io/test-libs-snapshot-local
```
Then use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzolov/computer-vision/master/CV-SNAPSHOT-stream-applications-rabbit-maven[CV-SNAPSHOT-stream-applications-rabbit-maven]
to bulk import the listed app starters:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzolov/computer-vision/master/CV-SNAPSHOT-stream-applications-rabbit-maven

```
 dataflow:>app import --uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzolov/computer-vision/master/CV-SNAPSHOT-stream-applications-rabbit-maven
```

## App Starters List

---

### webcam source
Webcam Source that allows reading video streams from integrated or USB-connected webcams. Reads the video stream from a webcam, extracts single video frames as images and feeds them to the outbound binder.

---

### frame-grabber source
https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[javaCV] (OpenCV java wrapper) powered processor
Reads a file or camera video stream, extracts single video frames as images and feeds them to the outbound binder.
You can configure the source location size of the output images and the frame grabbing interval.

### ocr-reader processor
*Description*: TODO

include::spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-ocr-reader/README.adoc[]

---

### qr-reader processor

Multi-format 1D/2D barcode image reader processor. Based on https://github.com/zxing/zxing[ZXing] ("Zebra Crossing") barcode scanning library for Java.

### face-detection-mtcnn processor

*Description*: WIP

include::spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-face-detection-mtcnn/README.adoc[]

---

### semantic-segmentation processor

*Description*: Real-time Semantic Image Segmentation processor with Tensorflow, Java and Spring Cloud Stream.
Semantic Segmentation is the process of associating each pixel of an image with a class label, (such as flower,
person, road, sky, ocean, or car).
